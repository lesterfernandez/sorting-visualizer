# Sorting Visualizer

## About

An application to observe popular sorting algorithms and their relative speed compared to each other.
Built with React.js, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS.

## Why?

I made this application when sorting algorithms peaked my interest and I decided it would be fun to create a sorting visualizer.
Particularly, merge sort interested me the most because of its simple yet elegant design.
I may add more algorithms to this project if other sorting methods peak my interest.

## How to run

- `git clone` this repository
- run `yarn` or `npm install`
- run `yarn start` or `npm start`

## Video

This entire project was built in one sitting and recorded. The video is publicly availble and features commentary on the build process.

## NOTE:

**If you came here from YouTube**, please note that I did some minor refactoring and orginization. I did not include this process in the video for the sake of time.
